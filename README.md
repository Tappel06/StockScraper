# StockScraper
my Java app that scrapes stock information from the internet

My very first App I ever wrote. If the settings are correctly modified, 
it will start to scrape specific websites for stock data according to the ticker you provide. 
it will then tell you if the stock is a valuable stock to purchase.

though this is my first program, after one year, I believe I can write a much better version now, this was just a prototype to improve my programming skills.

repository folder to import is /coded files/myWorkSpace
